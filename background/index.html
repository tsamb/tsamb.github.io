      <h2>in the beginning</h2>
      <p>
        I like to claim that I was the first kid in New Zealand on the internet. My mum got an email 
        address in the late 80s so she could communicate with her techie brother in Minnesota rather 
        than writing him a snail mail letter once a month. At the time, 
        <a href="http://downtothewire.co.nz/">dial-up wasn't available in New Zealand</a> 
        and so Mum had to wander down to the local polytechnic to email the only person in the world 
        she knew with email. As soon as dial-up was available at homes in NZ, Mum signed up. 
        (That must have been about 1992.)
      </p>
      <p>
        So, as a kid, I was mucking around with Gopher, Finger and Telnet protocols before the Web
        existed. I remember the first time I downloaded and played around with NCSA's
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)">Mosaic browser</a>
        on the family's Mac LCII. The Web was sparse back then and I preferred the fact that I could 
        download games from the Gopher servers I frequented. (Two days of downloading
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realmz">Realmz</a> on a 14.4k modem introduced me to
        role playing games.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I wasn't allowed consoles as a kid, much to my chagrin. I milked as much time as I could at 
        friends' houses who had Master Systems or Super Nintendos. Instead, I got my early game fix 
        playing classic Mac edutainment titles (shout out to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mario_educational_games">Mario Teaches Typing</a>
        and <a href="http://www.myabandonware.com/game/numbermaze-3nx">Number Maze</a>.) I graduated 
        onto the near-complete suite of Maxis titles of the 90s. SimCity 2000, SimTower and SimFarm
        particularly held my attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        More than anything, I liked to tutū around with the Mac. I hacked around with settings, 
        dabbled in HyperCard and was generally curious about what made the computer tick.

      <h2>the middle ages</h2>
      <p>
        My only experience with PCs prior to my teenage years was at friends' houses (playing games
        like Command and Conquer), at my dad's office (loading Total Annihilation onto a handful 
        of workstations and playing on the LAN) or at school (DOS and Windows 3.1 machines with 
        classic games like Commander Keen, Duke Nukem, Cosmo and Ski Or Die). I lusted after a PC. 
        And a console.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my couple of years at high school, the computer lab machines were still running Windows 
        3.1, even though Windows 95 had been out for years and XP was on the horizon. On these machines
        I learnt BASIC. By this time, my family had purchased a Windows PC for work Mum had to do. 
        On it, I had already been playing around with HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well as venturing 
        into Flash and ActionScript, back when it was cool. I even picked up a game design pack 
        that contained 3D modeling software and a C++ IDE.
      </p>
      <p>
        I ended up cramming quite a bit into my four and a half years of high school. My friend 
        Richard and I won the second place prize in the national science and technology fair. I 
        placed in the top percentile in New Zealand in some University of New South Wales computing 
        competition exam. Instead of 5th form in New Zealand, I spent 6 months with my Minnesotan 
        family in junior year at an American high school. I came back to New Zealand and completed 
        my 7th form classes in 6th form so I could go back and muck around in the States for another 
        semester. I received awards for top 6th form student in computing and English. With my 
        University Entrance certificate in hand, I headed back to high school in the US to finish off
        the final semester of senior year at the same high school.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon my return to New Zealand, six months before I was to head off to university, I worked 
        on a building site as a labourer and studied part time towards a teaching diploma to be able 
        to teach speech and drama. I had been involved speech and drama extracurricularly myself 
        from the age of six onwards — preparing for competitions for the first half of each year and 
        for examinations the second half. After working my way through all the Trinity College and 
        New Zealand Speech Board exams, I decided to get my own NZSB teaching diploma. This ended 
        up providing quite a good part-time self-employment opportunity through my years of 
        undergraduate study.
