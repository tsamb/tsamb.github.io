                <h2>javascript game paying homage to total annihilation</h2>
                <time>Tuesday 27 January, 2015</time>
                <p>I'm building a game in the browser. It is inspired by the
                    resource system of Chris Taylor's 1997 game Total Annihilation.
                </p>
                <p>This is one side project that I have been really amped to be
                    working on. Often I'll lose interest with toy projects after
                    a few days. This one, I'm excited to get home and work on.
                </p>
                <p>It's almost ready to be released into the wild as an alpha
                    release. At least, right now, all of the MVP mechanics are
                    there like resource generation, hp, damage etc. And I'm having
                    fun playing it locally.
                </p>
                <p>I'll probably throw it on this domain until I want to score
                    games and store those scores in some backend.

                <p>I figure I'll keep this site sweet and simple on the visual
                design and clean and clear on the structural (html)
                design. I intend to adhere to readable (human or machine) html
                with content in meaningful tags.</p>
                <p>I am more than open to constructive critique (i.e. a free
                code review) on these topics. Feel free to peruse my
                <a href ="https://github.com/tsamb/tsamb.github.io/commits/master">
                commit logs</a> and leave comments. I've also left
                <a href="https://github.com/tsamb/tsamb.github.io/issues">issues</a>
                on.</p>

                <p>I thought I ought to taste my own poison and draw up a
                GitHub pages site.</p>
