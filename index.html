                <h2>finding time</h2>
                <time>Saturday 14 February, 2015</time>
                <p>I really want to find a solid block of time every day to work on my own code and
                    projects. I'm struggling to work out when and where. I would love to be raring
                    to go at 5am in the morning, code until 7am and then head to work. We'll see.

                <h2>play my game. give me feedback</h2>
                <time>Sunday 8 February, 2015</time>
                <p>I'm still enjoying building this JavaScript game. I'm also enjoying playing it.
                    You can play it right now, <a href="/rts">right here.</a> It's not always up to
                    date with the most recent commits to the codebase. If you want to play the
                    bleeding edge version, you can download it and play it in your browser
                    <a href="https://github.com/tsamb/rts-tower-defence">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>I would love actionable, specific and kind feedback on any aspect of the game.
                    If you love gaming, tell me what about the mechanics you like, or dislike, or
                    what features would make it more fun and engaging. If you are a JS guru,
                    I'd love your feedback on how I can refactor my code to be more maintainable and
                    extensible.
                </p>
                <p>Feel free to give me feedback <a href="https://www.twitter.com/srossblack">by tweeting at me</a>
                    or you can leave an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/tsamb/rts-tower-defence">GitHub repo</a>.

                <h2>paying homage to total annihilation</h2>
                <time>Tuesday 27 January, 2015</time>
                <p>I'm building a game in the browser with canvas and JavaScript. It is inspired by the
                    resource system of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Taylor_(game_designer)">Chris Taylor</a>'s 1997 game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Annihilation">Total Annihilation</a>.
                </p>
                <p>This is one side project that I have been really amped to be
                    working on. Often I'll lose interest with toy projects after
                    a few days. This one, I'm excited to get home and work on.
                </p>
                <p>It's almost ready to be released into the wild as an alpha
                    release. At least, right now, all of the MVP mechanics are
                    there like resource generation, hp, damage etc. And I'm having
                    fun playing it locally.
                </p>
                <p>I'll probably throw it on this domain until I want to score
                    games and store those scores in some backend.
                </p>
                <p>Finally, to truly pay homage, I'll need a score as good as TA. We'll see.

                <time>Sunday 20 April, 2014</time>
                <p>I figure I'll keep this site sweet and simple on the visual
                design and clean and clear on the structural (html)
                design. I intend to adhere to readable (human or machine) html
                with content in meaningful tags.</p>
                <p>I am more than open to constructive critique (i.e. a free
                code review) on these topics. Feel free to peruse my
                <a href ="https://github.com/tsamb/tsamb.github.io/commits/master">
                commit logs</a> and leave comments. I've also left
                <a href="https://github.com/tsamb/tsamb.github.io/issues">issues</a>
                on.</p>
