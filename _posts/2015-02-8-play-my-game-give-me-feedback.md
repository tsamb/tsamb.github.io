<p>I'm still enjoying building this JavaScript game. I'm also enjoying playing it.
You can play it right now, <a href="/rts">right here.</a> It's not always up to
date with the most recent commits to the codebase. If you want to play the
bleeding edge version, you can download it and play it in your browser
<a href="https://github.com/tsamb/rts-tower-defence">here</a>.
</p>
<p>I would love actionable, specific and kind feedback on any aspect of the game.
If you love gaming, tell me what about the mechanics you like, or dislike, or
what features would make it more fun and engaging. If you are a JS guru,
I'd love your feedback on how I can refactor my code to be more maintainable and
extensible.
</p>
<p>Feel free to give me feedback <a href="https://www.twitter.com/srossblack">by tweeting at me</a>
or you can leave an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/tsamb/rts-tower-defence">GitHub repo</a>.
