<p>I figured it was nigh on time to give the ol' website a bit of a spruce up. 
Nothing major in terms of design, but I decided I ought to have a real home to 
show who I am and what I love doing / making / building.
</p>
<p>
I ended up registering a couple of domain names which I'll resolve to the site
are currently on: <a href="http://www.samuelrblackman.com">samuelrblackman.com</a> 
and <a href="http://www.srb.nyc">srb.nyc</a>. I can't believe I missed the boat on 
both <a href="http://www.samblackman.com">samblackman.com</a> and 
<a href="http://www.samuelblackman.com">samuelblackman.com</a>. I should have 
been all over that since the late nineties.

<p>
Currently, this whole site is still entirely static and hosted on GitHub Pages. 
That means, of course, you can always access it via 
<a href="http://tsamb.github.io">tsamb.github.io</a>. The next task on my list 
is to migrate the code to <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, which is 
about the only dynamism to be had on GitHub Pages. (I'm not complaining, I think 
GitHub Pages is fantastic.) Jekyll will
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> up the code 
a bit with templates, make it more maintainable and make this blogging process more 
modular.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, I'm having fun kicking it old school with my pals, HTML and CSS.
