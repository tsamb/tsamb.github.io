title:  "paying homage to total annihilation"

<p>I'm building a game in the browser with canvas and JavaScript. It is inspired by the
  resource system of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Taylor_(game_designer)">Chris Taylor</a>'s 1997 game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Annihilation">Total Annihilation</a>.
</p>
<p>This is one side project that I have been really amped to be
  working on. Often I'll lose interest with toy projects after
  a few days. This one, I'm excited to get home and work on.
</p>
<p>It's almost ready to be released into the wild as an alpha
  release. At least, right now, all of the MVP mechanics are
  there like resource generation, hp, damage etc. And I'm having
  fun playing it locally.
</p>
<p>I'll probably throw it on this domain until I want to score
  games and store those scores in some backend.
</p>
<p>Finally, to truly pay homage, I'll need a score as good as TA. We'll see.
