<p>I figure I'll keep this site sweet and simple on the visual
design and clean and clear on the structural (html)
design. I intend to adhere to readable (human or machine) html
with content in meaningful tags.</p>
<p>I am more than open to constructive critique (i.e. a free
code review) on these topics. Feel free to peruse my
<a href ="https://github.com/tsamb/tsamb.github.io/commits/master">
commit logs</a> and leave comments. I've also left
<a href="https://github.com/tsamb/tsamb.github.io/issues">issues</a>
on.</p>
