This website is my foray into ground-up html and css. No templates, no generators, no fancy stuff. My goal is clean design from the ground-up using best practices all the way. If you spy anything but a best practice, or even worse, an anti-pattern, please let me know. And if you are to let me know, please constructively back it up with references to reputable sources.
